# Annotate Audio Events
Currently we are working on a project for audio classification. 
We are utilizing deep learning methods to train the models. 
We are looking for students who are willing to help us annotate the dataset in their spare time.

We will provide you the non-annotated dataset of ~10 sec audio files and an annotation portal. Interested students please fill up [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/jyMjN9sYpn).

Participation certificate will be provided for annotating more than 1000 files. There will be monetary reward (as per DoRD norms) per file annotated correctly.
