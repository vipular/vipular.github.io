# Guidelines
- No LoR or PVF without tangible progress
- It is your responsibility to present your progress in time (once a week)

# How to apply
UGs willing to do projects with me (UGP or otherwise) can apply for the following projects. Send me an email with the heading "[UG Project Appl] \<Project Name\>".

<!-- NOTE: I have received a large number of requests for SURGE. I can accept your request if you can show me your progress on the problem you want to work on.
- Give me a detailed project proposal of what you will be doing. I have given you the problem (if not, take one of the following).
- If you are working with me already, give a presentation on your progress.
Mention if you have done an ML course with me before.
- I will accept your request only if you give a satisfactory presentation and proposal (1-2 pages). -->

<!-- ## Automatic Speech Recognition
Needs knowledge of machine learning and time series models taught in EE603A (MLSP). -->

<!-- ## Audio Analysis on Android
Needs knowledge of Android app development. It involves building a front end (on Android) for signal processing and machine learning tools (these tools will mostly run on a server). **Open for all, including junior undergrads**. Music knowledge is a plus. **Remote work** possible. You can also work on related machine learning problems side by side. -->

<!-- ## DCASE challenge
(http://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection)[http://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection] <br>
This is an annual international challenge on machine learning.
We are forming a team from IITK to participate for 2022. -->

# Projects 
(Updated on 16 October 2023)

## Generative Modeling
Build generative models (akin to GPT, diffusion models, GANs) for image generation. Stipend available.

## Audio Search
If you have a partial, possibly noisy, audio recording, can you find out the original audio file from a large database?

## Spoken Term Detection
If you wish to find certain terms spoken by someone, can you locate them in the audio files in a large database?

<!-- ## Models for Music Teaching
Involves working with our music teacher(s) to study learning behavior of students, and to make computational models of the same. You need to be **on campus** for this project. You can also work on machine learning aspects of it side by side. -->

<!-- ## Time Series Analysis for Air Quality Sensors
Building ML models for regression. Relevant papers: 
- Sonu Kumar Jha, Mohit Kumar, Vipul Arora, Sachchida Nand Tripathi, Vidyanand Motiram Motghare, and A. A. Shingare, “Domain adaptation based deep calibration of low-cost PM2.5 sensors”, IEEE Sensors Journal, 2021.
- Kalpit Yadav, Vipul Arora, Sonu Kumar Jha, Mohit Kumar, and Sachchida Nand Tripathi. "Few-shot calibration of low-cost air pollution (PM2. 5) sensors using meta-learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.00640 (2021). 

## Query by Humming
If you remember the tune of a song, can you search that song by humming the tune?
