## Course Objectives:
This course aims at introducing the students to advanced topics in machine learning (ML). 
The main focus will be on Generative machine learning.
The lectures will focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based assignments for implementation.

## Pre-requisites:
- Basic course on machine learning (EE698V, EE603A or equivalent). (Lecture videos)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbtAaXHMto-sQHH1qrYn8_D9Fze_D1KhE]
- Basics of Programming (ESc101 or equivalent)

The course will need a strong background in linear algebra and probability theory.

## Topics:

- Deep Neural Networks
- Generative Machine Learning
	- Random sampling (Monte Carlo methods)
	- Variational Inference
	- Generative Adversarial Networks
	- Normalizing Flows
  - Diffusion Models
- Other topics of interest, such as
  - Trustworthy AI (Model calibration, confidence estimation)
  - Explainable AI (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM)
  - Human in the loop learning (mislabeling detection, active learning)
  - Data efficient machine learning (small data, model adaptation, semi-supervised learning)

<!-- ## Grading Scheme
- Course Notes - 5% <br>
- Coding Quiz 1 - 10% <br>
- Mid-semester Exam – 30% <br>
- Project or Coding Quizzes – 25% <br> 
- Class participation in presentations - 5% (bonus) <br>
- End-semester Exam – 30% <br>

### Plagiarism Penalty:<br>
As heavy as possible. Zero-tolerance policy.

## References:
  This course will take excerpts from some standard books on machine
  learning and signal processing. But it will largely be based on
  articles and research papers in ML and SP conferences (e.g.,
  NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, Interspeech, ICASSP, etc.) and journals (e.g., IEEE
  TASLP, JMLR, IEEE PAMI, etc.).
