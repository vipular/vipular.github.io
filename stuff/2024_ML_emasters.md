## Course Objectives:
  This course aims to introduce the students to machine learning (ML) techniques used for various engineering applications. The lectures will focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based assignments for implementation, introducing students to tools such as sklearn and keras.

## Pre-requisites:
There are no official pre-requisites for the course. But you may brush up your knowledge of the basics of linear algebra and probability theory.

## Topics:
-	Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Linear models and neural networks
- Image, audio and text processing
