# Machine Learning for Signal Processing - EE903 (eMasters)

## Vipul Arora <br> Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur

## Course Objectives:
  This course aims at introducing machine learning (ML) techniques used for various signal
  processing applications. There will be spectral processing methods 
  for analysis and transformation of signals. The lectures will
  focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based
  assignments for implementation. Prior exposure to ML is not
  required. Intuitive understanding and illustrative examples will be provided for easy grasp of the principles.

## Pre-requisites:
There are no official pre-requisites for the course. But you may brush up your knowledge of the basics of linear algebra and probability theory.

## Topics:

- Digital Signal Processing basics
- Machine Learning basics
  - Supervised Machine Learning
  - Model Evaluation
- Linear Regression and Classification
- Neural Networks
- Programming Tools: Tensorflow and Keras
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- Some Applications in Signal Processing (time permitting)
